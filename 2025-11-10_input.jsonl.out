Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nAround >95% of all companies in manufacturing/engineering/design fall under the SME category (and there’s over 250,000 of these companies in the US alone) which means they’re not able to invest multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars up front required to have these capabilities right now.   Our thought is that if you lose the ability to insource 3D printing, the advantages of the technology go away.   The end result of this, is that SMB’s (and even big-co’s) aren’t innovating nearly as much as they could be – meaning less product development cycles before having to commit to a final design. The problem also manifests itself in customization – right now, it’s not cost-effective to build customized products so a majority of products built are standardized.  The other result is that 3D printing isn’t being used for any meaningful production volumes, because the cost-per-part is too high.

It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

Yet it is barely a $8bn market worldwide (and ~4bn for plastics). This is because it’s not cost effective when compared to other production methods.   With our price point, and materials capability, we’re expanding the useful scope of 3D printing to the $30bn low-volume production market immediately.

We're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.

We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nPrint3D  Print3D designs and builds affordable and high-quality 3D printers with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques by offering the possibility for all small business to access industrial 3D printing solutions in-house. Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping. These high-end plastics are strong enough to replace metals in most situations, and can operate at high temperatures (including under the hood of a car, or in a sterilization environment). This 'tipping point' is what we believe will help this industry drive forward.  Our secret sauce lies in our fundamental understanding of how materials work, and how to process them. It’s the key factor in our product design methodology, and is the basis of how we build defensibility. Building robots is something people can copy, but dealing with the intricacies of materials is hard.  Problem: Manufacturing is hard   Right now, for a business, the process to making a part is really complex. You have to deal with high costs ($ thousands) and long lead times (weeks) to outsource, and if you make a mistake in design, the process has to be repeated. You’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.\n\n---\n\nEuropean Union (EU) - EMC Directive for the European Union (EU) \t\tMassachusetts, USA\t\t$   37,500.00  \t\tApril 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity Type\t\tDescription\t\tLocation\t\tCost  \t\t1\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (5 days) for 2 people at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t2\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t3\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in French of marketing tools and materials for French audience at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   6,000.00  \t\t4\n\n---\n\nrelated to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in French of marketing tools and materials for French audience at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   6,000.00  \t\t4\t\t6/25/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (4 days) for 2 employees at AFPR Paris (June 25-27)\t\tParis, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t5\t\t6/25/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tEvent registration for 2 employees at AFPR Paris (June 25-27)\t\tParis, France\t\t$   240.00  \t\t6\t\t6/25/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (4 days) for 2 employees at RapidTech Fabcon Erfurt (June 25-27)\t\tErfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,000.00  \t\t7\t\t6/25/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tEvent registration for 2 employees at RapidTech Fabcon Erfurt (June 25-27)\t\tErfurt, Germany\t\t$   240.00  \t\t8\n\n---\n\n, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,240 $  \t\tAPS Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-20 March\t\t2\t\t4    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t100\t\t\t\t200 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t4\t\t400 $\t\t3,200 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,800 $  \t\tEuropean certifications    \t\tMarch-April  \t\tSee Intertek quotation January 2019  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t45,100 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for CSA and UL\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t2,500 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for FCC\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t6,900 $    \t\tTotal for the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35,700 $    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal budget\t\t162,880 $      CanExport budget  \t\tApril 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019\n\n---\n\nClarke: The only one belonging to 2017 \t\t\t\tChina  \t\tCreadditive \t\t$   27,645.24\t\tCanada\t\tOntario  \t\tDenroy\t\t$   26,959.44\t\tUK\t\tNorthern Ireland  \t\tFermilab\t\t$   21,381.77\t\tUSA\t\tIllinois  \t\tFiretrace\t\t$   18,899.77\t\tUSA\t\tArizona  \t\tGeneral Dynamics\t\t$   32,675.39\t\tUSA\t\tFlorida  \t\tHayden \t\t$   3,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tCalifornia  \t\tLifetime\t\t$   19,963.77\t\tUSA\t\tUtah  \t\tL'Oreal\t\t$   27,466.88\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tMeridian OneCap Credit\t\t$   42,021.41\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tMindmatter\t\t\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tNasser\t\t$   27,199.15\t\tSaudi Arabia  \t\tNorplas\t\t$   25,499.15\t\tUSA\t\tOhio  \t\tNuvera\t\t$   5,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tMassachussetts  \t\tNuvera\t\t$   16,761.40\n\n---\n\nYou’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time. This changes the economics of products that aren’t mass produced (like custom machinery, robotics, medical devices), as well as having implications in research & development.  3D Printing is supposed to be the solution – it’s faster, more flexible than traditional manufacturing and doesn’t suffer from complicated setups or tooling costs like traditional manufacturing. That being said, there are a few core problems holding it back -- which can be summarized by:  You can pick cheap, or useful, but not both.   1. Low cost printers are unreliable, can’t use materials with any redeeming performance qualities to speak of.   1. High end industrial units are major capital expenditures and too expensive to in-source. ($150k+, mandatory service contracts, DRM-locked consumables at absurd price multiples á la razor & blade model). They aren’t competitive with other techniques on a cost-per-part basis.  Around >95% of all companies in manufacturing/engineering/design fall under the SME category (and there’s over 250,000 of these companies in the US alone) which means they’re not able to invest multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars up front required to have these capabilities right now.\n\nQuestion:\nWhen does the project start?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_01CiEjZkUnEoKEtM7woVeK6U","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"April 1, 2018"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5437,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":10}},"recordId":"2"}

We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nThis trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nMade in 3D Canada Inc. (Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\n/Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in German of marketing tools and materials for German audience at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent\t\tTotal 2018-2019\t\t$   43,300.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal 2019-20120\t\t$   121,380.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrand Total\t\t$   164,680.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithout UK\t\t\t\t$   130,480.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithout UK, without certifications\t\t\t\t$   92,980.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithout March expenses, without UK\t\t\t\t$   87,180.00\n\n---\n\n8    1        Company Summary  Randeep Singh  randeep@aon3d.com    Overview:    · We've built the first industrial 3D printer with the price and performance necessary to replace traditional manufacturing techniques.   · We give the 99% of businesses that couldn't afford an industrial 3D printing solution in-house, access to one.  · Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle).   · Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this.  · We've shipped over 70 units to customers already, with preorders for over 40 more.  · Nominated for 'Enterprise 3D printer of the year' by a major industry blog (3DPrintingIndustry).  · Machines cost ~$25,000 and we have a 60% margin.

We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\nQuestion:\nWho handles financial claims for the company?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_016HixSnn5vVPMi5XHJ617HJ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"The context provided does not contain information about who handles financial claims for the company."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5279,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":19}},"recordId":"5"}

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\nMade in 3D Canada Inc. (Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nTools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\n/Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in German of marketing tools and materials for German audience at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent\t\tTotal 2018-2019\t\t$   43,300.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal 2019-20120\t\t$   121,380.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGrand Total\t\t$   164,680.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithout UK\t\t\t\t$   130,480.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithout UK, without certifications\t\t\t\t$   92,980.00  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWithout March expenses, without UK\t\t\t\t$   87,180.00\n\n---\n\nrental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   23,200.00  \t\t10\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\n/Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\n8    1        Company Summary  Randeep Singh  randeep@aon3d.com    Overview:    · We've built the first industrial 3D printer with the price and performance necessary to replace traditional manufacturing techniques.   · We give the 99% of businesses that couldn't afford an industrial 3D printing solution in-house, access to one.  · Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle).   · Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this.  · We've shipped over 70 units to customers already, with preorders for over 40 more.  · Nominated for 'Enterprise 3D printer of the year' by a major industry blog (3DPrintingIndustry).  · Machines cost ~$25,000 and we have a 60% margin.

These high-end plastics are strong enough to replace metals in most situations, and can operate at high temperatures (including under the hood of a car, or in a sterilization environment). This 'tipping point' is what we believe will help this industry drive forward.  Our secret sauce lies in our fundamental understanding of how materials work, and how to process them. It’s the key factor in our product design methodology, and is the basis of how we build defensibility. Building robots is something people can copy, but dealing with the intricacies of materials is hard.  Problem: Manufacturing is hard     Right now, for a business, the process to making a part is really complex. You have to deal with high costs ($ thousands) and long lead times (weeks) to outsource, and if you make a mistake in design, the process has to be repeated. You’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.    Executive Summary:    We’ve build the first 3D printer with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques. Our printers are designed to work with advanced, high-strength thermoplastics, so customers can build useful parts, quickly. We're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.   \n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\nQuestion:\nWho manages this project?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_01FMdpy5mGQt59J87wYdoUGJ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Randeep Singh"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5534,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":8}},"recordId":"6"}

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.

Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.\n\n---\n\nOnce they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nMade in 3D Canada Inc. (Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nOpportunity    Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house. Yet it is barely a $8bn market worldwide (and ~4bn for plastics). This is because it’s not cost effective when compared to other production methods.   With our price point, and materials capability, we’re expanding the useful scope of 3D printing to the $30bn low-volume production market immediately.  Our focus on high-strength materials is making these markets even bigger. These materials can replace metal in a lot of situations, which hasn’t been factored into previous market sizing calculations. The market for ultra-high-end plastics is $13bn right now, and would be bigger, if it wasn’t so hard to work with those plastics. We've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.\n\n---\n\nOpportunity  Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house.

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nThis trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.

Executive Summary:    We’ve build the first 3D printer with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques. Our printers are designed to work with advanced, high-strength thermoplastics, so customers can build useful parts, quickly. We're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.   \n\nQuestion:\nWhen does the project end?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_012Z6S14HakLSWqVo4hi5eVW","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"March 31, 2020"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5663,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":10}},"recordId":"3"}

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster).

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nSheet1  \t\tClient\t\tTotal Invoice  \t\t3DRapid Print\t\t$   26,495.44\t\tUK  \t\tArdent cell\t\t$   22,888.22\t\tUSA\t\tNew York  \t\tAutomation Product Group\t\t$   10,499.65\t\tUSA\t\tUtah  \t\tBic\t\t$   19,491.99\t\tUSA\t\tFlorida  \t\tBlue Origin\t\t\t\tUSA\t\tWashington  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   22,026.58\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   5,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   4,166.00\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCCMB\t\t$   53,868.84\t\tCanada\t\tManitoba  \t\tCejep Thetford\t\t$   24,757.99\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tChris O'Brian Lifehouse\t\t$   22,465.25\t\tAustralia\t\tNew South Wales  \t\tCloudbay  Edith Clarke: Edith Clarke: The only one belonging to 2017 \t\t\t\tChina  \t\tCreadditive \t\t$   27,645.24\t\tCanada\t\tOntario  \t\tDenroy\t\t$   26,959.44\t\tUK\n\n---\n\nTools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\n$\t\t43,300 $    \t\tOverall Budget plan Formnext 19-22 November  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50,500 $  \t\tAFPR Paris  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t25-27 Juin\t\t2\t\t4    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t120\t\t\t\t240 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t4\t\t400 $\t\t3,200 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,840 $  \t\tIndustrie Expo Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t5-8 March\t\t2\t\t6    \t\tEvent registration for employees\t\t2\t\t120\t\t\t\t240 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a\n\n---\n\nReal budget expenses  \t\t3DPrint Lyon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReasons  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t  Travel for meetings/events with key contacts from target market  \t\t4-6 June\t\t4\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\to   Participation to trade events to meet key contacts from target market  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\to   Interpretation services for target market  \t\tTravel fees\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\to   Marketing tools- adaptation and translation for target market  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t4\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t4,800 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination\t\t\t\to   IP protection/certification/ adaptation of contracts for target market  \t\tPer diem (food)\t\t4\t\t5\t\t150 $\t\t3,000 $\t\t\t\t\t\to   * Business, tax or legal advice for target market  \t\tPer diem (accomodation)\t\t4\t\t4\t\t160 $\t\t2,560 $\t\t\t\t\t\to   * Market research/ key contacts identification/b2b for target market  \t\tPer diem (local transport)\t\t4\t\t4\t\t60 $\t\t960 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11,320 $    \t\tShow attendance  \t\tEvent registration for employees\t\t4\t\tfree\t\t\t\t0 $  \t\tCosts associated to participating or exhibiting for the first time in a\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the company's international sales revenues?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_01DzpPCRWqLMJCRMxxuGT2vV","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Based on the financial data provided:\n\n- 2018 (3/31/18): $528,711.01\n- 2017 (3/31/17): $229,611.00"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5206,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":48}},"recordId":"19"}

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster).

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.

Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure.

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools.

Yet it is barely a $8bn market worldwide (and ~4bn for plastics). This is because it’s not cost effective when compared to other production methods.   With our price point, and materials capability, we’re expanding the useful scope of 3D printing to the $30bn low-volume production market immediately.  Our focus on high-strength materials is making these markets even bigger. These materials can replace metal in a lot of situations, which hasn’t been factored into previous market sizing calculations. The market for ultra-high-end plastics is $13bn right now, and would be bigger, if it wasn’t so hard to work with those plastics. We've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.\n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.    Executive Summary:    We’ve build the first 3D printer with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nWe've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.   The beauty of 3D printing is that it exists a layer directly after a design is modeled, so there are applications in countless other industries like: surgical tooling, automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, mannequins, lighting & fixture design, maintenance, and essentially any industry that designs parts using CAD software. The end-customer habit isn't being changed, since they still need to produce the parts they’re designing.    Solution  We make it easy to build high-strength, functional parts using 3D printing. We’ve built an industrial-grade 3D printer that works with high-strength materials, but is affordable enough to insource and use for meaningful production volumes.     We’re also making the technology easier to use, by creating automated material processing frameworks for customers, so they don’t have to figure out how to use different materials themselves.    Product   The current version of the product is a large-volume 3D printer with specifications that can be seen on our website: aon3d.com    The printer is compatible with the highest-strength thermoplastics in the world, including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU, and more.   Our printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution.\n\n---\n\nSheet1  \t\tClient\t\tTotal Invoice  \t\t3DRapid Print\t\t$   26,495.44\t\tUK  \t\tArdent cell\t\t$   22,888.22\t\tUSA\t\tNew York  \t\tAutomation Product Group\t\t$   10,499.65\t\tUSA\t\tUtah  \t\tBic\t\t$   19,491.99\t\tUSA\t\tFlorida  \t\tBlue Origin\t\t\t\tUSA\t\tWashington  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   22,026.58\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   5,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   4,166.00\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCCMB\t\t$   53,868.84\t\tCanada\t\tManitoba  \t\tCejep Thetford\t\t$   24,757.99\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tChris O'Brian Lifehouse\t\t$   22,465.25\t\tAustralia\t\tNew South Wales  \t\tCloudbay  Edith Clarke: Edith Clarke: The only one belonging to 2017 \t\t\t\tChina  \t\tCreadditive \t\t$   27,645.24\t\tCanada\t\tOntario  \t\tDenroy\t\t$   26,959.44\t\tUK\n\n---\n\nWe've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.

The potential for these materials to change industries is massive. PEEK for example has a greater strength-to-weight ratio than aluminum, is fully biocompatible, highly resistant to chemicals, and has one of the highest operating temperatures (480F) of any plastics. Another plastic, PPS is invulnerable to any known chemical at temperatures under 400F.    Essentially, these plastics excel when you need high strength, chemical, and temperature resistance, and low weight.    Traction  · $1.7m + of sales booked in last 12 months.  · Early customers include:          Business Model    To start we just sell hardware, but over-time we're planning to move to a recurring revenue model.     NOW:  · Sell Hardware ($25k, 60% margins)  SHORT TERM:  · Sell Consumables via a value-add strategy. Using our materials will save customers on average 40h of testing per material. We estimated $350-1000 / unit / month on average, at a 30-50% margin.  · Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).\n\n---\n\nIn a couple weeks from now, we’ll also be among the very first in the entire world to commercialize PSU and PPS for 3D printing.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).

[inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.\n\n---\n\n)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-22 November\t\t2\t\t6    \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t5 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t6\t\t400 $\t\t4,800 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,200 $    \t\tShow attendance  \t\tEvent registration for employees\t\t2\t\t150\t\t300 $\t\t300 $  \t\tCosts associated to participating or exhibiting for the first time in a trade show \t\t\t\t\t\t25,000 $\t\t25,000 $\t\tbudget (inclut locatin espace, transprot du material de booth…)  \t\tAir freight of 1 machine back and forth\t\t\t\t\t\t6,000 $\t\t6,000 $  \t\tAdaptation and translation of marketing material for German market\t\t\t\t\t\t12,000 $\t\t12,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t43,300 $\t\t43,300 $    \t\tOverall Budget plan Formnext 19-22 November  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50,500 $  \t\tAFPR Paris  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\n\n---\n\n, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,240 $  \t\tAPS Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-20 March\t\t2\t\t4    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t100\t\t\t\t200 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t4\t\t400 $\t\t3,200 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,800 $  \t\tEuropean certifications    \t\tMarch-April  \t\tSee Intertek quotation January 2019  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t45,100 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for CSA and UL\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t2,500 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for FCC\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t6,900 $    \t\tTotal for the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35,700 $    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal budget\t\t162,880 $      CanExport budget  \t\tApril 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019\n\n---\n\nfor employees\t\t2\t\t120\t\t\t\t240 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t6\t\t400 $\t\t4,800 $  \t\tSubtotal  \t\tRapidTech Fabcon Erfurt  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t25-27 Juin\t\t2\t\t2    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t120\t\t\t\t240 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,500 $\t\t3,000 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,240 $  \t\tAPS Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-20 March\n\n---\n\nEuropean Union (EU) - EMC Directive for the European Union (EU) \t\tMassachusetts, USA\t\t$   37,500.00  \t\tApril 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity Type\t\tDescription\t\tLocation\t\tCost  \t\t1\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (5 days) for 2 people at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t2\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t3\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in French of marketing tools and materials for French audience at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   6,000.00  \t\t4\n\n---\n\nYou’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time. This changes the economics of products that aren’t mass produced (like custom machinery, robotics, medical devices), as well as having implications in research & development.  3D Printing is supposed to be the solution – it’s faster, more flexible than traditional manufacturing and doesn’t suffer from complicated setups or tooling costs like traditional manufacturing. That being said, there are a few core problems holding it back -- which can be summarized by:  You can pick cheap, or useful, but not both.   1. Low cost printers are unreliable, can’t use materials with any redeeming performance qualities to speak of.   1. High end industrial units are major capital expenditures and too expensive to in-source.

The consumables on average cost 3-4x less as well.    Technology    Our FFF technology can use thermoplastics which are already widely used in industry and familiar to engineers – this last part is a critical advantage over other 3D printing technologies as anything unfamiliar to engineers or not already certified for industrial applications must go through a drawn-out and expensive qualification process on the order of 5-10 years in safety-critical verticals like aerospace.     Of all the thermoplastics available, only a few have been commercialized for 3D printing right now – primarily due to lack of available hardware to use them.     The above is known in the industry as the “plastics pyramid”.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nIn Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.  In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\nOur printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution.

Estimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.\n\n---\n\nrental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   23,200.00  \t\t10\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\n/Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\nTools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\nEuropean Union (EU) - EMC Directive for the European Union (EU) \t\tMassachusetts, USA\t\t$   37,500.00  \t\tApril 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity Type\t\tDescription\t\tLocation\t\tCost  \t\t1\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (5 days) for 2 people at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t2\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t3\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in French of marketing tools and materials for French audience at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   6,000.00  \t\t4\n\nQuestion:\nWhat certifications or regulatory approvals is the company pursuing or has obtained?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_01QmgSnFoMJW1rDfG2NPRC4C","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Based on the context provided, the company is pursuing the following EU certifications:\n\n- Low Voltage Directive for the European Union (EU)\n- EMC Directive for the European Union (EU)\n\nThese certifications are being obtained through testing and evaluation by Intertek, with fees of $37,500 allocated for this purpose."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5156,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":75}},"recordId":"16"}

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nSheet1  \t\tYear of incorporation:\t\t2015  \t\tFiscal Year end\t\tMarch 31st  \t\tCRA Business number\t\t-  \t\tParent/ Subsidiary:\t\tNo  \t\t# Full time employees based on T4 slips from 2018 calendar year\t\t35  \t\tNumber of employees dedicated to international business development  \t\t\t\t3/31/18\t\t3/31/17  \t\tAnnual revenue\t\t662,098.27\t\t332,302.00  \t\tAnnual Canadian revenue\t\t133,387.26\t\t102,691.00  \t\tInternational revenue:\t\t528,711.01\t\t229,611.00  \t\tInternational BD Spent:\t\t\t\t17,083.00\n\n---\n\nYou’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time. This changes the economics of products that aren’t mass produced (like custom machinery, robotics, medical devices), as well as having implications in research & development.  3D Printing is supposed to be the solution – it’s faster, more flexible than traditional manufacturing and doesn’t suffer from complicated setups or tooling costs like traditional manufacturing. That being said, there are a few core problems holding it back -- which can be summarized by:  You can pick cheap, or useful, but not both.   1. Low cost printers are unreliable, can’t use materials with any redeeming performance qualities to speak of.   1.

Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.\n\n---\n\nThe fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.   Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.\n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.    Executive Summary:    We’ve build the first 3D printer with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques. Our printers are designed to work with advanced, high-strength thermoplastics, so customers can build useful parts, quickly. We're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.   \n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.

In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).

[inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.\n\n---\n\nTrade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.

It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nIn a couple weeks from now, we’ll also be among the very first in the entire world to commercialize PSU and PPS for 3D printing.    The potential for these materials to change industries is massive. PEEK for example has a greater strength-to-weight ratio than aluminum, is fully biocompatible, highly resistant to chemicals, and has one of the highest operating temperatures (480F) of any plastics. Another plastic, PPS is invulnerable to any known chemical at temperatures under 400F.    Essentially, these plastics excel when you need high strength, chemical, and temperature resistance, and low weight.    Traction  · $1.7m + of sales booked in last 12 months.  · Early customers include:          Business Model    To start we just sell hardware, but over-time we're planning to move to a recurring revenue model.     NOW:  · Sell Hardware ($25k, 60% margins)  SHORT TERM:  · Sell Consumables via a value-add strategy. Using our materials will save customers on average 40h of testing per material. We estimated $350-1000 / unit / month on average, at a 30-50% margin.  · Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).\n\n---\n\nTrade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure.

The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time. This changes the economics of products that aren’t mass produced (like custom machinery, robotics, medical devices), as well as having implications in research & development.  3D Printing is supposed to be the solution – it’s faster, more flexible than traditional manufacturing and doesn’t suffer from complicated setups or tooling costs like traditional manufacturing. That being said, there are a few core problems holding it back -- which can be summarized by:  You can pick cheap, or useful, but not both.   1. Low cost printers are unreliable, can’t use materials with any redeeming performance qualities to speak of.   1. High end industrial units are major capital expenditures and too expensive to in-source. ($150k+, mandatory service contracts, DRM-locked consumables at absurd price multiples á la razor & blade model). They aren’t competitive with other techniques on a cost-per-part basis.  Around >95% of all companies in manufacturing/engineering/design fall under the SME category (and there’s over 250,000 of these companies in the US alone) which means they’re not able to invest multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars up front required to have these capabilities right now.\n\n---\n\nYou’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.

We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.

Our thought is that if you lose the ability to insource 3D printing, the advantages of the technology go away.   The end result of this, is that SMB’s (and even big-co’s) aren’t innovating nearly as much as they could be – meaning less product development cycles before having to commit to a final design. The problem also manifests itself in customization – right now, it’s not cost-effective to build customized products so a majority of products built are standardized.  The other result is that 3D printing isn’t being used for any meaningful production volumes, because the cost-per-part is too high.  Opportunity  Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house.\n\n---\n\nSheet1  \t\tYear of incorporation:\t\t2015  \t\tFiscal Year end\t\tMarch 31st  \t\tCRA Business number\t\t-  \t\tParent/ Subsidiary:\t\tNo  \t\t# Full time employees based on T4 slips from 2018 calendar year\t\t35  \t\tNumber of employees dedicated to international business development  \t\t\t\t3/31/18\t\t3/31/17  \t\tAnnual revenue\t\t662,098.27\t\t332,302.00  \t\tAnnual Canadian revenue\t\t133,387.26\t\t102,691.00  \t\tInternational revenue:\t\t528,711.01\t\t229,611.00  \t\tInternational BD Spent:\t\t\t\t17,083.00\n\nQuestion:\nWhat certifications or testing is required?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_019aC2m7Bc8krfPJN2rRcQGc","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Based on the context provided, the certifications and testing required include:\n\n**For European Union markets:**\n- Low Voltage Directive for the European Union (EU)\n- EMC Directive for the European Union (EU)\n\n**For North American markets:**\n- CSA certification\n- UL certification  \n- FCC certification\n\nThe testing and evaluation for the EU certifications is being conducted by Intertek at a cost of $37,500."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5305,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":100}},"recordId":"45"}

The consumables on average cost 3-4x less as well.    Technology    Our FFF technology can use thermoplastics which are already widely used in industry and familiar to engineers – this last part is a critical advantage over other 3D printing technologies as anything unfamiliar to engineers or not already certified for industrial applications must go through a drawn-out and expensive qualification process on the order of 5-10 years in safety-critical verticals like aerospace.     Of all the thermoplastics available, only a few have been commercialized for 3D printing right now – primarily due to lack of available hardware to use them.     The above is known in the industry as the “plastics pyramid”. The materials placed higher on the pyramid are the highest-performing and the highest value to industry, but of the top half of the pyramid, only PPSU and PEI (Ultem) have been commercialized, and even then just barely (we’re one of maybe 5 printers that can work with these materials).     We’re also on the forefront of commercializing PEEK, where we’re working with the top two suppliers in the world to customize a formulation specifically for 3D printing.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nTrade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure.

This changes the economics of products that aren’t mass produced (like custom machinery, robotics, medical devices), as well as having implications in research & development.  3D Printing is supposed to be the solution – it’s faster, more flexible than traditional manufacturing and doesn’t suffer from complicated setups or tooling costs like traditional manufacturing. That being said, there are a few core problems holding it back -- which can be summarized by:  You can pick cheap, or useful, but not both.   1. Low cost printers are unreliable, can’t use materials with any redeeming performance qualities to speak of.   1. High end industrial units are major capital expenditures and too expensive to in-source.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.    CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.\n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.

These high-end plastics are strong enough to replace metals in most situations, and can operate at high temperatures (including under the hood of a car, or in a sterilization environment). This 'tipping point' is what we believe will help this industry drive forward.  Our secret sauce lies in our fundamental understanding of how materials work, and how to process them.

Building robots is something people can copy, but dealing with the intricacies of materials is hard.  Problem: Manufacturing is hard   Right now, for a business, the process to making a part is really complex. You have to deal with high costs ($ thousands) and long lead times (weeks) to outsource, and if you make a mistake in design, the process has to be repeated. You’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

Another plastic, PPS is invulnerable to any known chemical at temperatures under 400F.

businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the certification or testing costs?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_015AbVSUzCMN6CMf2oCAo7oV","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"$37,500.00\n\nThis cost is for testing and evaluation by Intertek to obtain EU certifications including the Low Voltage Directive and EMC Directive for the European Union."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5250,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":43}},"recordId":"46"}

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools.

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\n, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,240 $  \t\tAPS Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-20 March\t\t2\t\t4    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t100\t\t\t\t200 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t4\t\t400 $\t\t3,200 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,800 $  \t\tEuropean certifications    \t\tMarch-April  \t\tSee Intertek quotation January 2019  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t45,100 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for CSA and UL\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t2,500 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for FCC\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t6,900 $    \t\tTotal for the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35,700 $    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal budget\t\t162,880 $      CanExport budget  \t\tApril 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019\n\n---\n\nSheet1  \t\tClient\t\tTotal Invoice  \t\t3DRapid Print\t\t$   26,495.44\t\tUK  \t\tArdent cell\t\t$   22,888.22\t\tUSA\t\tNew York  \t\tAutomation Product Group\t\t$   10,499.65\t\tUSA\t\tUtah  \t\tBic\t\t$   19,491.99\t\tUSA\t\tFlorida  \t\tBlue Origin\t\t\t\tUSA\t\tWashington  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   22,026.58\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   5,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCaroba\t\t$   4,166.00\t\tUSA\t\tColorado  \t\tCCMB\t\t$   53,868.84\t\tCanada\t\tManitoba  \t\tCejep Thetford\t\t$   24,757.99\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tChris O'Brian Lifehouse\t\t$   22,465.25\t\tAustralia\t\tNew South Wales  \t\tCloudbay  Edith Clarke: Edith Clarke: The only one belonging to 2017 \t\t\t\tChina  \t\tCreadditive \t\t$   27,645.24\t\tCanada\t\tOntario  \t\tDenroy\t\t$   26,959.44\t\tUK\n\n---\n\nThe fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.   Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nMinus the North American part for FCC\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t6,900 $    \t\tTotal for the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35,700 $    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal budget\t\t162,880 $      CanExport budget  \t\tApril 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity Type\t\tDescription\t\tLocation\t\tCost  \t\t1\t\t3/19/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (4 days) for 2 people at APS Lyon (March 19-20)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t2\t\t3/19/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tEvent registration for 2 employees at APS Lyon (March 19-20)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   200.00  \t\t3\t\t3/25/19\t\tIP Protection/Certification/Adapt Contracts for Target Markets\t\tFees related to testing and evaluation by Intertek to obtain the following EU certifications: - Low Voltage Directive for the European Union (EU) - EMC Directive for the European Union (EU) \t\tMassachusetts, USA\t\t$   37,500.00  \t\tApril 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity\n\n---\n\nOnce they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nTools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\nThis allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nMarketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.

CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nOpportunity    Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house. Yet it is barely a $8bn market worldwide (and ~4bn for plastics). This is because it’s not cost effective when compared to other production methods.   With our price point, and materials capability, we’re expanding the useful scope of 3D printing to the $30bn low-volume production market immediately.  Our focus on high-strength materials is making these markets even bigger. These materials can replace metal in a lot of situations, which hasn’t been factored into previous market sizing calculations. The market for ultra-high-end plastics is $13bn right now, and would be bigger, if it wasn’t so hard to work with those plastics. We've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.\n\n---\n\nrental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   23,200.00  \t\t10\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\nOpportunity  Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house.

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.\n\n---\n\nThis trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.\n\n---\n\nSheet1  \t\tYear of incorporation:\t\t2015  \t\tFiscal Year end\t\tMarch 31st  \t\tCRA Business number\t\t-  \t\tParent/ Subsidiary:\t\tNo  \t\t# Full time employees based on T4 slips from 2018 calendar year\t\t35  \t\tNumber of employees dedicated to international business development  \t\t\t\t3/31/18\t\t3/31/17  \t\tAnnual revenue\t\t662,098.27\t\t332,302.00  \t\tAnnual Canadian revenue\t\t133,387.26\t\t102,691.00  \t\tInternational revenue:\t\t528,711.01\t\t229,611.00  \t\tInternational BD Spent:\t\t\t\t17,083.00\n\n---\n\nSaudi Arabia  \t\tNorplas\t\t$   25,499.15\t\tUSA\t\tOhio  \t\tNuvera\t\t$   5,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tMassachussetts  \t\tNuvera\t\t$   16,761.40\t\tUSA\t\tMassachussetts  \t\tOakridge\t\t$   23,996.26\t\tUSA\t\tTennessee  \t\tPatuxent Mill Works, LLC\t\t19,262.83\t\tUSA\t\tMaryland  \t\tPatuxent Mill Works, LLC\t\t5,000.00\t\tUSA\t\tMaryland  \t\tPolytechinque Montreal\t\t$   22,115.19\t\tCanada\t\tQuebec  \t\tStellar Exploration\t\t$   15,999.56\t\tUSA\t\tCalifornia  \t\tStratamach\t\t$   28,566.10\t\tUSA\t\tMichigan  \t\tTPC\t\t$   5,000.00\t\tCanada\t\tSaskatchewan  \t\tUSAF\t\t$   19,413.76\t\tUSA\t\tOhio  \t\tVirgina Tech\t\t$   16,611.24\t\tUSA\t\tVirginia  \t\t\t\t$   662,098.27  \t\t\t\t\t\tUK\t\t$   53,454.88\n\n---\n\nWe are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.\n\n---\n\nYou’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time. This changes the economics of products that aren’t mass produced (like custom machinery, robotics, medical devices), as well as having implications in research & development.  3D Printing is supposed to be the solution – it’s faster, more flexible than traditional manufacturing and doesn’t suffer from complicated setups or tooling costs like traditional manufacturing. That being said, there are a few core problems holding it back -- which can be summarized by:  You can pick cheap, or useful, but not both.   1. Low cost printers are unreliable, can’t use materials with any redeeming performance qualities to speak of.   1. High end industrial units are major capital expenditures and too expensive to in-source. ($150k+, mandatory service contracts, DRM-locked consumables at absurd price multiples á la razor & blade model). They aren’t competitive with other techniques on a cost-per-part basis.  Around >95% of all companies in manufacturing/engineering/design fall under the SME category (and there’s over 250,000 of these companies in the US alone) which means they’re not able to invest multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars up front required to have these capabilities right now.\n\n---\n\nYou’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.

In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\nOnce they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.

We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.    CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nMade in 3D Canada Inc. (Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\n, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,240 $  \t\tAPS Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-20 March\t\t2\t\t4    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t100\t\t\t\t200 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t4\t\t400 $\t\t3,200 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,800 $  \t\tEuropean certifications    \t\tMarch-April  \t\tSee Intertek quotation January 2019  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t45,100 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for CSA and UL\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t2,500 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for FCC\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t6,900 $    \t\tTotal for the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35,700 $    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal budget\t\t162,880 $      CanExport budget  \t\tApril 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019\n\n---\n\nWe are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nrental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   23,200.00  \t\t10\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\n)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-22 November\t\t2\t\t6    \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t5 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t6\t\t400 $\t\t4,800 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,200 $    \t\tShow attendance  \t\tEvent registration for employees\t\t2\t\t150\t\t300 $\t\t300 $  \t\tCosts associated to participating or exhibiting for the first time in a trade show \t\t\t\t\t\t25,000 $\t\t25,000 $\t\tbudget (inclut locatin espace, transprot du material de booth…)  \t\tAir freight of 1 machine back and forth\t\t\t\t\t\t6,000 $\t\t6,000 $  \t\tAdaptation and translation of marketing material for German market\t\t\t\t\t\t12,000 $\t\t12,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t43,300 $\t\t43,300 $    \t\tOverall Budget plan Formnext 19-22 November  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50,500 $  \t\tAFPR Paris  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\n\n---\n\nMarketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.

CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nThis trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\n, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,240 $  \t\tAPS Lyon  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-20 March\t\t2\t\t4    \t\tParticipation at a tradeshow to meet potential clients: Event registration \t\t2\t\t100\t\t\t\t200 $  \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t2 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t4\t\t400 $\t\t3,200 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,800 $  \t\tEuropean certifications    \t\tMarch-April  \t\tSee Intertek quotation January 2019  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t45,100 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for CSA and UL\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t2,500 $  \t\tMinus the North American part for FCC\t\t\t\tminus\t\t\t\t6,900 $    \t\tTotal for the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35,700 $    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal budget\t\t162,880 $      CanExport budget  \t\tApril 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019\n\n---\n\nThis allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.

Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure.

We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS.

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nOur printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution. The consumables on average cost 3-4x less as well.    Technology    Our FFF technology can use thermoplastics which are already widely used in industry and familiar to engineers – this last part is a critical advantage over other 3D printing technologies as anything unfamiliar to engineers or not already certified for industrial applications must go through a drawn-out and expensive qualification process on the order of 5-10 years in safety-critical verticals like aerospace.     Of all the thermoplastics available, only a few have been commercialized for 3D printing right now – primarily due to lack of available hardware to use them.     The above is known in the industry as the “plastics pyramid”. The materials placed higher on the pyramid are the highest-performing and the highest value to industry, but of the top half of the pyramid, only PPSU and PEI (Ultem) have been commercialized, and even then just barely (we’re one of maybe 5 printers that can work with these materials).     We’re also on the forefront of commercializing PEEK, where we’re working with the top two suppliers in the world to customize a formulation specifically for 3D printing.   In a couple weeks from now, we’ll also be among the very first in the entire world to commercialize PSU and PPS for 3D printing.\n\n---\n\nOur printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution.

Yet it is barely a $8bn market worldwide (and ~4bn for plastics). This is because it’s not cost effective when compared to other production methods.   With our price point, and materials capability, we’re expanding the useful scope of 3D printing to the $30bn low-volume production market immediately.  Our focus on high-strength materials is making these markets even bigger. These materials can replace metal in a lot of situations, which hasn’t been factored into previous market sizing calculations. The market for ultra-high-end plastics is $13bn right now, and would be bigger, if it wasn’t so hard to work with those plastics. We've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.\n\n---\n\nAround >95% of all companies in manufacturing/engineering/design fall under the SME category (and there’s over 250,000 of these companies in the US alone) which means they’re not able to invest multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars up front required to have these capabilities right now.   Our thought is that if you lose the ability to insource 3D printing, the advantages of the technology go away.   The end result of this, is that SMB’s (and even big-co’s) aren’t innovating nearly as much as they could be – meaning less product development cycles before having to commit to a final design. The problem also manifests itself in customization – right now, it’s not cost-effective to build customized products so a majority of products built are standardized.  The other result is that 3D printing isn’t being used for any meaningful production volumes, because the cost-per-part is too high.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nOnce they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.

This 'tipping point' is what we believe will help this industry drive forward.  Our secret sauce lies in our fundamental understanding of how materials work, and how to process them.

Building robots is something people can copy, but dealing with the intricacies of materials is hard.  Problem: Manufacturing is hard   Right now, for a business, the process to making a part is really complex. You have to deal with high costs ($ thousands) and long lead times (weeks) to outsource, and if you make a mistake in design, the process has to be repeated. You’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nPrint3D  Print3D designs and builds affordable and high-quality 3D printers with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques by offering the possibility for all small business to access industrial 3D printing solutions in-house. Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there.

Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nOpportunity  Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house. Yet it is barely a $8bn market worldwide (and ~4bn for plastics). This is because it’s not cost effective when compared to other production methods.   With our price point, and materials capability, we’re expanding the useful scope of 3D printing to the $30bn low-volume production market immediately.  Our focus on high-strength materials is making these markets even bigger. These materials can replace metal in a lot of situations, which hasn’t been factored into previous market sizing calculations. The market for ultra-high-end plastics is $13bn right now, and would be bigger, if it wasn’t so hard to work with those plastics. We've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.\n\n---\n\nTrade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\n/Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing of marketing tools and materials for Biritish audience at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   4,000.00  \t\t11\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (6 days) for 2 people at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   7,200.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at Formnext Germany (November 19-22)), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tFankfurt, Germany\t\t$   31,300.00  \t\t12\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the company's recent revenues and financial performance?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_017JvTtYh1HBgSV1wVc2J83J","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Based on the provided information:\n\n**Annual Revenue:**\n- 2018 (March 31st): $662,098.27\n- 2017 (March 31st): $332,302.00\n\n**Revenue Breakdown (2018):**\n- Canadian revenue: $133,387.26\n- International revenue: $528,711.01\n\n**Recent Performance:**\n- $1.7+ million of sales booked in the last 12 months\n- Over 70 units shipped to customers with preorders for 40+ more\n- Machines cost ~$25,000 with 60% margin\n- Revenue doubled from 2017 to 2018\n- International revenue represents approximately 80% of total revenue"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5142,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":165}},"recordId":"13"}

The consumables on average cost 3-4x less as well.    Technology    Our FFF technology can use thermoplastics which are already widely used in industry and familiar to engineers – this last part is a critical advantage over other 3D printing technologies as anything unfamiliar to engineers or not already certified for industrial applications must go through a drawn-out and expensive qualification process on the order of 5-10 years in safety-critical verticals like aerospace.     Of all the thermoplastics available, only a few have been commercialized for 3D printing right now – primarily due to lack of available hardware to use them.     The above is known in the industry as the “plastics pyramid”. The materials placed higher on the pyramid are the highest-performing and the highest value to industry, but of the top half of the pyramid, only PPSU and PEI (Ultem) have been commercialized, and even then just barely (we’re one of maybe 5 printers that can work with these materials).     We’re also on the forefront of commercializing PEEK, where we’re working with the top two suppliers in the world to customize a formulation specifically for 3D printing.   In a couple weeks from now, we’ll also be among the very first in the entire world to commercialize PSU and PPS for 3D printing.\n\n---\n\nOur printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution.

It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nMarketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.

[inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.\n\n---\n\nEuropean Union (EU) - EMC Directive for the European Union (EU) \t\tMassachusetts, USA\t\t$   37,500.00  \t\tApril 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity Type\t\tDescription\t\tLocation\t\tCost  \t\t1\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (5 days) for 2 people at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t2\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t3\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in French of marketing tools and materials for French audience at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   6,000.00  \t\t4\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).

[inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.

The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nThe fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.   Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nOnce they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\nOpportunity    Manufacturing is a $12T industry, and of that, $600bn is spent making plastic parts. $30bn is spent on low-volume production (less than 4000 units) of plastic parts, yearly. 3DP specifically is an $8bn market, growing at 30% y/y.  3D printing allows for rapid iteration, no initial tooling costs, and the ability to make complex parts not possible thru any other method, and has the ability to operate in-house.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.

Another plastic, PPS is invulnerable to any known chemical at temperatures under 400F.    Essentially, these plastics excel when you need high strength, chemical, and temperature resistance, and low weight.

We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.    CONFIDENTIAL\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.     Our thought is that if we make useful materials accessible (ie. easy to use, affordable), engineers & designers will be able to utilize 3D printing in a significantly larger percentage of their work, and this will make it the new standard in the way products are developed. 3D printing is currently being used by big companies (Fortune 500) in this way – we're opening up the tech to every other business (99% of American manufacturing firms have less than 30 employees).   It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nIn Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.  In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping. These high-end plastics are strong enough to replace metals in most situations, and can operate at high temperatures (including under the hood of a car, or in a sterilization environment). This 'tipping point' is what we believe will help this industry drive forward.  Our secret sauce lies in our fundamental understanding of how materials work, and how to process them. It’s the key factor in our product design methodology, and is the basis of how we build defensibility. Building robots is something people can copy, but dealing with the intricacies of materials is hard.  Problem: Manufacturing is hard   Right now, for a business, the process to making a part is really complex. You have to deal with high costs ($ thousands) and long lead times (weeks) to outsource, and if you make a mistake in design, the process has to be repeated. You’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

The beauty of 3D printing is that it exists a layer directly after a design is modeled, so there are applications in countless other industries like: surgical tooling, automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, mannequins, lighting & fixture design, maintenance, and essentially any industry that designs parts using CAD software. The end-customer habit isn't being changed, since they still need to produce the parts they’re designing.    Solution    We make it easy to build high-strength, functional parts using 3D printing. We’ve built an industrial-grade 3D printer that works with high-strength materials, but is affordable enough to insource and use for meaningful production volumes.     We’re also making the technology easier to use, by creating automated material processing frameworks for customers, so they don’t have to figure out how to use different materials themselves.    Product   The current version of the product is a large-volume 3D printer with specifications that can be seen on our website: aon3d.com    The printer is compatible with the highest-strength thermoplastics in the world, including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU, and more.   Our printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution.\n\n---\n\nWe've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS.

Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the company hope to achieve through this project?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_014Sbv149hDamnSK4H7Eejsn","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Based on the context, the company hopes to achieve the following through this project:\n\n1. **Establish US market presence** - They currently have no channel partners in the US and minimal exposure, making it difficult to sell into the market\n\n2. **Acquire channel partners and distributors** - The trade show is estimated to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US, which will become their primary sales channel\n\n3. **Increase revenue** - Projected increase in revenue of US$1,200,000 from approximately 40 unit sales resulting from the trade show\n\n4. **Target specific high-value customers** - Demonstrate products to Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC\n\n5. **Gain industry exposure and credibility** - Showcase products alongside other companies at the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year to progressively gain more credibility in the space\n\nThe RAPID+TCT trade show is described as \"essential to our export strategy\" and \"instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales.\""}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5223,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":244}},"recordId":"28"}

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\nIn Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.  In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\nThe fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.   Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nMade in 3D Canada Inc. (Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nEuropean Union (EU) - EMC Directive for the European Union (EU) \t\tMassachusetts, USA\t\t$   37,500.00  \t\tApril 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020  \t\t#\t\tDate\t\tActivity Type\t\tDescription\t\tLocation\t\tCost  \t\t1\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (5 days) for 2 people at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   5,600.00  \t\t2\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   12,000.00  \t\t3\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt./Transl/. for Target Market\t\tFees related to the design, editing, adaptation, printing and translation in French of marketing tools and materials for French audience at 3DPrint Lyon (June 4-6)\t\tLyon, France\t\t$   6,000.00  \t\t4\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster).

Our thought is that if you lose the ability to insource 3D printing, the advantages of the technology go away.   The end result of this, is that SMB’s (and even big-co’s) aren’t innovating nearly as much as they could be – meaning less product development cycles before having to commit to a final design. The problem also manifests itself in customization – right now, it’s not cost-effective to build customized products so a majority of products built are standardized.  The other result is that 3D printing isn’t being used for any meaningful production volumes, because the cost-per-part is too high.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\nTrade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\n)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\t\tTotal  \t\t19-22 November\t\t2\t\t6    \t\tTravel fees  \t\tFlights (economy)\t\t2\t\t\t\t1,200 $\t\t2,400 $\t\tEconomy round trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t5 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t6\t\t400 $\t\t4,800 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7,200 $    \t\tShow attendance  \t\tEvent registration for employees\t\t2\t\t150\t\t300 $\t\t300 $  \t\tCosts associated to participating or exhibiting for the first time in a trade show \t\t\t\t\t\t25,000 $\t\t25,000 $\t\tbudget (inclut locatin espace, transprot du material de booth…)  \t\tAir freight of 1 machine back and forth\t\t\t\t\t\t6,000 $\t\t6,000 $  \t\tAdaptation and translation of marketing material for German market\t\t\t\t\t\t12,000 $\t\t12,000 $  \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t43,300 $\t\t43,300 $    \t\tOverall Budget plan Formnext 19-22 November  \t\tGrand total\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t50,500 $  \t\tAFPR Paris  \t\t\t\tNb of people attending\t\tnr of days (show days + 2)\t\tUnit cost CAD$\n\n---\n\nround trip tickets from Montreal to town of destination  \t\t5 days per-diems for a max of 2 employees to attend trade show and meet potential clients, partners, representatives\t\t2\t\t5\t\t400 $\t\t4,000 $      \t\tSubtotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5,600 $  \t\tBudget plan -

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nThis allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events.

These high-end plastics are strong enough to replace metals in most situations, and can operate at high temperatures (including under the hood of a car, or in a sterilization environment). This 'tipping point' is what we believe will help this industry drive forward.  Our secret sauce lies in our fundamental understanding of how materials work, and how to process them. It’s the key factor in our product design methodology, and is the basis of how we build defensibility. Building robots is something people can copy, but dealing with the intricacies of materials is hard.  Problem: Manufacturing is hard   Right now, for a business, the process to making a part is really complex. You have to deal with high costs ($ thousands) and long lead times (weeks) to outsource, and if you make a mistake in design, the process has to be repeated. You’re also at the mercy of your suppliers – if one is late, your whole production schedule can be offset.  The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

It's a pretty obvious vision – if you can test the parts you're building, and there are ‘initial setup costs’ like with other technologies, it makes development faster and more iterative. If the parts are sufficiently strong & accurate, you can use them for production in final applications.  The big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.\n\n---\n\nWe're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

The beauty of 3D printing is that it exists a layer directly after a design is modeled, so there are applications in countless other industries like: surgical tooling, automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, mannequins, lighting & fixture design, maintenance, and essentially any industry that designs parts using CAD software. The end-customer habit isn't being changed, since they still need to produce the parts they’re designing.    Solution    We make it easy to build high-strength, functional parts using 3D printing.

In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\nIn a couple weeks from now, we’ll also be among the very first in the entire world to commercialize PSU and PPS for 3D printing.    The potential for these materials to change industries is massive. PEEK for example has a greater strength-to-weight ratio than aluminum, is fully biocompatible, highly resistant to chemicals, and has one of the highest operating temperatures (480F) of any plastics. Another plastic, PPS is invulnerable to any known chemical at temperatures under 400F.    Essentially, these plastics excel when you need high strength, chemical, and temperature resistance, and low weight.

Using our materials will save customers on average 40h of testing per material. We estimated $350-1000 / unit / month on average, at a 30-50% margin.  · Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).\n\n---\n\nThis trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.    Executive Summary:    We’ve build the first 3D printer with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques. Our printers are designed to work with advanced, high-strength thermoplastics, so customers can build useful parts, quickly. We're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.  We support the strongest plastics in the world (including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU & more), which have properties that rival metals, or feature significant chemical resistance for harsh applications.   \n\n---\n\nIn a couple weeks from now, we’ll also be among the very first in the entire world to commercialize PSU and PPS for 3D printing.    The potential for these materials to change industries is massive. PEEK for example has a greater strength-to-weight ratio than aluminum, is fully biocompatible, highly resistant to chemicals, and has one of the highest operating temperatures (480F) of any plastics. Another plastic, PPS is invulnerable to any known chemical at temperatures under 400F.    Essentially, these plastics excel when you need high strength, chemical, and temperature resistance, and low weight.    Traction    · $1.7m + of sales booked in last 12 months.x  · Early customers include:          Business Model      To start we just sell hardware, but over-time we're planning to move to a recurring revenue model.     NOW:  · Sell Hardware ($25k, 60% margins)  SHORT TERM:  · Sell Consumables via a value-add strategy. Using our materials will save customers on average 40h of testing per material. We estimated $350-1000 / unit / month on average, at a 30-50% margin.  · Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).\n\n---\n\nThe fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.   Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the company do and what products or services does it offer?"}]}]},"modelOutput":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","id":"msg_bdrk_01NqPaRfVXTvNeAbL9ZPKY7a","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"The company (AON3D/Made in 3D Canada Inc.) builds industrial 3D printers designed to work with high-strength thermoplastics.

The immediate result: small runs of parts are really expensive, and take a long time.\n\n---\n\nThe big change that made this possible is materials – high-end plastics are being commercialized, and the prices are dropping.

Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster).

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nThis trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26. We are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.  The following team members will be attending the event.  1.    \n\n---\n\nWe've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.   The beauty of 3D printing is that it exists a layer directly after a design is modeled, so there are applications in countless other industries like: surgical tooling, automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, mannequins, lighting & fixture design, maintenance, and essentially any industry that designs parts using CAD software. The end-customer habit isn't being changed, since they still need to produce the parts they’re designing.    Solution  We make it easy to build high-strength, functional parts using 3D printing. We’ve built an industrial-grade 3D printer that works with high-strength materials, but is affordable enough to insource and use for meaningful production volumes.     We’re also making the technology easier to use, by creating automated material processing frameworks for customers, so they don’t have to figure out how to use different materials themselves.    Product   The current version of the product is a large-volume 3D printer with specifications that can be seen on our website: aon3d.com    The printer is compatible with the highest-strength thermoplastics in the world, including PEEK, Ultem, PPSU, and more.   Our printer costs $15k, as opposed to over $100k for an incumbent solution.\n\n---\n\nWe've created the most efficient way to work with high-strength plastics, because additive manufacturing wastes significantly less material than traditional subtractive processes.

Defensibility   The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition    We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers.\n\n---\n\nPrint3D  Print3D designs and builds affordable and high-quality 3D printers with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques by offering the possibility for all small business to access industrial 3D printing solutions in-house. Our printers are compatible with the strongest thermoplastics in the world, that are strong enough to replace metals, but work in harsh chemical environments (a place where metals struggle). Our technology is based on FFF/FDM and we’re building on top of this. PRINT3D is a rapidly growing Quebec-based business who has heavily invested in product development in the past years but is now focused on increasing sales across the board. With our core activities currently tapping into the North American market (the largest in additive manufacturing), we intend to rapidly expand to other international markets as to catalyze our growth. The European Union is the second largest market for additive manufacturing in the world, with France and Germany being two of the largest markets within the EU.     For example: In France, the aerospace and medical industries are well established and utilizing both traditional manufacturing and additive manufacturing techniques, and we intend to tap into the market of large companies who are using expensive industrial-grade 3D printing machines and encourage a shift to high-performance but lower cost solutions.  In Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.\n\n---\n\n· Sell Software-as-a-Service (a value-add printer-management suite that will offer enhanced functionality compared to off-the-shelf solutions).  · Validate 'producing parts as a service' model (Starting in China – selling at $20/hr for machines + materials cost).  LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]  EXPORT STRATEGY  · Combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Attracting international channel partners will be possible by attending tradeshows in Québec, Canada and internationally.  · Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Quebec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.\n\n---\n\nEstimate $400+ per month on average in consumables per device at 30-50% margin.  · Customers see 5-8x (on avg) reduction in operating costs compared to competing systems.  · Producing parts out of plastic is a $600bn market, but 3DP is only $8bn because existing solutions are either too expensive for production, or not capable of producing useful parts.   · 3DP market is growing ~30% year over year – our immediate addressable market includes over 250k businesses in the manufacturing space.    Executive Summary:    We’ve build the first 3D printer with the price and performance to replace traditional manufacturing techniques. Our printers are designed to work with advanced, high-strength thermoplastics, so customers can build useful parts, quickly. We're doing this at price of 5-10x less that existing incumbent options, so that we can make this tech accessible to the hundreds of thousands of businesses that used to have to outsource.

We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.   We are estimating this show to be the main lead source for getting resellers and distribution partners in the US - which will then turn into our primary sales channel there. We also have had minimal exposure as a company in the US, and this is the biggest additive manufacturing event of the year. Indeed, we aren't officially in any US markets right now, other than via customers ordering from our webpage.   Attending RAPID+TRT will be instrumental to our export strategy, both in attracting channel partners and increasing unit sales. Projected increase in revenue from the tradeshow is US$1,200,000 from an estimate of approximately 40 unit sales. Specific customers targeted at the event that we want to demonstrate our products to include Boeing, Stratamach, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Plastics Parts INC.  PROJECT COSTS  The main project costs are included in the budget in Annexe A   The RAPID+TCT tradeshow is in Fort Worth, Texas, from April 23 to 26.

(Aon 3D Inc.)  Export Program: Project description  GENERAL EXPORT STRATEGY  Our general export strategy is to combine relationships with local channel partners (distributors, resellers, and boutique consulting firms), with a strong outbound marketing strategy.  Customers will ideally be aware of our products, the fact that they are manufactured in Québec, and request them from the same source to get the rest of their machine tools. The fact we are manufactured in Québec is a strong competitive advantage because local/North American customers appreciate the fact that machines aren’t built overseas.     Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure, as much in Québec, Canada and internationally. The trade show season starts in late April and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year. This allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION  The main international trade show we are attending this year, and the objective of this project, is RAPID + TCT in Fort Worth Texas, from April 23-26. This trade show is essential to our export strategy. We are looking to increase sales in the US across the board but we don’t currently have any channel partners in the US at this point, which makes it significantly harder to sell into the market.\n\n---\n\nWe are planning on arriving April 22 and returning on April 27, once the tradeshow ends.

LONG TERM:  · Evaluate a leasing model for the hardware -- if we can reduce the cost barrier to entry, the solution can be evaluated by businesses on a straight monthly cost-savings approach, which is beneficial. i.e. even if we charge $1000/mo + consumables, it has a 1-2 job per month payback period (not including benefits gained due to getting parts faster). [inspired by Xerox model]    Defensibility     The core of our defensibility model comes from: executing our hardware roadmap (w/ an IP strategy) to fundamentally make the devices build stronger parts, using materials research to improve workflows and reduce the technical barriers, and building better software for more advanced machine control.    We’re also working with some companies coming straight out of academia that have extremely interesting technologies that want to use our hardware as a go-to-market platform.      We also benefit from extremely high switching costs -- generally, when customers purchase industrial machinery it's for YEARS. Once they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching.\n\n---\n\n7,000.00  \t\t7\t\t6/25/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tEvent registration for 2 employees at RapidTech Fabcon Erfurt (June 25-27)\t\tErfurt, Germany\t\t$   240.00  \t\t8\t\t6/4/19\t\tTravel for Meetings/events w/ Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tTravel and per diem (5 days) for 2 people at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26)\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   7,000.00  \t\t9\t\t6/4/19\t\tParticipation at Trade Events to Meet Key Contacts from Target Market\t\tExpenses and fees related to exhibiting at TCT Birmingham (September 24-26), including: - Event registration for 2 employees - Trade show rental fees - Shipping and handling for booth materials and equipment - Registration costs\t\tBirmingham, UK\t\t$   23,200.00  \t\t10\t\t6/4/19\t\tMarketing Tools - Adapt.\n\n---\n\nOnce they train their staff on a specific workflow, it's even harder to justify switching. We're doubling down on this by putting a lot of resources into building better & more efficient workflows - both from the software and hardware side.   This can be expanded upon significantly more in-person.    Marketing / Customer Acquisition      We are going to acquire customers through 4 main channels:     · Content Marketing  · Regional Distributors  · Trade-Shows  · Outbound efforts     Content Marketing & Online Advertising:   There is a huge lack of quality content in the 3D printing industry - especially that aimed at industrial customers. Most of the content that exist is regarding consumer/hobbyist devices, so a lot of value can be derived from focusing on engineering applications. An opportunity exists to become a major knowledge base for the industry, which will drive significant amounts of traffic as the industry grows.    Distributors:  Over 15 distributors have cold-reached out, asking to rep our product. Distribution is the most efficient way to reach mass scale, since many clients need localized service & support. Distributors have estimated moving between 2-15 units per month (depending on size), with some offering to purchase units up-front.    Trade Shows:  Trade shows are the best way to get industry exposure. The trade show season starts in May and we will be attending most of the larger shows this year.\n\n---\n\nIn Germany, we intend on targeting smaller manufacturing businesses who cannot afford to work with high quality plastics in their processes as the market there is very competitive.  In the UK, we have identified the markets of competitive racing and aeronautics as areas of special interest, however the rest of the manufacturing industry is also growing with additive manufacturing and design in mind.\n\n---\n\nThis allows us to showcase our products to distributors as they frequently attend these types of events. We will progressively gain more credibility as the products are showcased alongside other companies in the space.    Outbound Sales:  In addition to launching more content & more news features, we’re building case-studies around our existing customers so that we can launch outbound sales. This was initially held back because customers were scared to purchase from a new company, but validation through trade-blogs & having more customers has made the process much more efficient.
