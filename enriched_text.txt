Alright. OK.  00:17:41 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:17:43 Speaker 1  So I'll work with that.  00:17:46 Speaker 1  And I'll probably be able to.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

Audio file  Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  If it works, yeah. So the the recorder is on.  00:00:06 Speaker 1  So maybe I would let you explain what was done last year and we'll start from there.  00:00:15 Speaker 2  OK, perfect. So just to confirm it's from the period of January to May.  00:00:21 Speaker 2  Or OK.  00:00:21 Speaker 1  Yes, correct.

---

00:06:05 Speaker 1  It's pretty good.  00:06:07 Speaker 1  Because here we were seeing the analysis of a predicate catheter.  00:06:12 Speaker 1  So predicate cadre, what does that mean?

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

So right now it's kind of been a combination of all of those aspects that have come together to make the mold that we're working on now.  00:03:21 Speaker 2  Still, some adjustments to be made, but we're getting closer.  00:03:25  OK.  00:03:27 Speaker 1  UM, OK.  00:03:34 Speaker 1  OK, let's uh covers it and.  00:03:37 Speaker 2  There.  00:03:38 Speaker 2  Also, I guess a new challenge that arose with the balloons as well. So the balloons are only partially inflated. They're not fully inflated. So they're a little.  00:03:50  Soft.  00:03:51 Speaker 2  So that you can measure low pressures because if you put too much air in the Blues it it will be there will be over pressurized so you won't. You won't detect small changes and and pressure and that's not good for disease patients because they read naturally.  00:04:10 Speaker 2  Very low pressures in the abdomen. So a challenge that we came across was that the material had a certain shape memory.

---

00:06:05 Speaker 1  It's pretty good.  00:06:07 Speaker 1  Because here we were seeing the analysis of a predicate catheter.  00:06:12 Speaker 1  So predicate cadre, what does that mean?

---

So what we did you described before was really the balloon.  00:07:25 Speaker 2  I can pull up a diagram that might be easier so I can show you.  00:07:25 Speaker 1  For the measurement.  00:07:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:31  And.  00:07:38 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:38 Speaker 2  Those necks on on both like this little piece here and here and throughout the centre of the balloons. And then this portion here on the large.  00:07:47 Speaker 2  1.  00:07:48 Speaker 1  OK, so that's the design of the neck to assemble the the larger balloon onto the the shaft of the the device. Right. OK. And what? OK. So what were the issues with? Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck.


QUESTION #3: Who is the Project Report Lead?

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK.

Alright. OK.  00:17:41 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:17:43 Speaker 1  So I'll work with that.  00:17:46 Speaker 1  And I'll probably be able to.

---

So there have been iterations around the molded.  00:11:38 Speaker 2  Part just to to make it work from a manufacturing stuff.  00:11:44 Speaker 2  Points compared to the initial design we had made. So there's been quite a bit of back and forth and we've recently received the first molded connector that required some additional design changes, but.  00:12:04 Speaker 2  Is close to being a finished a finished component.  00:12:11 Speaker 2  For the gasket as well, we've launched molding of the gasket. We determined that specific material for the gasket provided the best seals. There were multiple iterations of testing done to figure out the right thermometer of material that would be required.  00:12:31 Speaker 2  For the seal.  00:12:32 Speaker 2  So we decided on a 3D A and launched molding of that component. So that was also due this year.  00:12:43 Speaker 2  UM and we assembled for the first time this inflation tubing and the stock.

So the the recorder is on.  00:00:06 Speaker 1  So maybe I would let you explain what was done last year and we'll start from there.  00:00:15 Speaker 2  OK, perfect. So just to confirm it's from the period of January to May.  00:00:21 Speaker 2  Or OK.  00:00:21 Speaker 1  Yes, correct.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

So that was also due this year.  00:12:43 Speaker 2  UM and we assembled for the first time this inflation tubing and the stock. There were some challenges actually with the joint here between the inflation tubing and the stopcock we were seeing failures.  00:13:02 Speaker 2  In that joint earlier than we would have wanted, and so we were doing tensile testing on that joint and it wasn't withstanding the forces that we were.  00:13:11 Speaker 2  Want so we did different iterations with different glues and the shape of the glue. So we actually the final design that we've decided on is a tapered glue joint between the stock clock and the tubing. And that's allowed us to withstand higher.  00:13:31 Speaker 2  Horses.  00:13:32 Speaker 1  This is the inflation tube for the large balloon.  00:13:36 Speaker 2  Yes, correct. Correct.  00:13:37 Speaker 1  OK. All right.  00:13:40 Speaker 1  OK. What were the issues that you mentioned you were doing different?  00:13:44 Speaker 1  Trials for the.  00:13:47 Speaker 1  The the joining of the the neck of the big balloon to the the shaft.

---

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

---

OK. Yeah. So there were there were iterations that they would suggest that they would say, OK, we're not able to remove it. We think changing the angles would be the right course of action. We redesigned the balloon and went back to the.  00:15:04 Speaker 1  So is is it so?  00:15:18 Speaker 2  To the supplier to to change the drawings. And there's been about 5 back and forth iterations with them on that.  00:15:27 Speaker 1  OK, so it's the the the 1st.  00:15:31 Speaker 1  Portion of the balloon the from the shaft to where there's the angle. This is a A.  00:15:38 Speaker 1  Rigid portion of the.  00:15:41 Speaker 2  No, it's all. It's all soft material. The whole balloon is soft material. And the reason we wanted it so small here for the neck of the balloon was so that it would be the exactly the same size as the shaft that it's being split on to so that it could be bonded very easily.  00:15:57 Speaker 1  Mm-hmm.  00:16:01 Speaker 1  OK.  00:16:03 Speaker 1  Yeah.


QUESTION #5: What is the Planned End Date?

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK.

OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck. Yeah and.  00:08:22 Speaker 2  So there were some challenges with manufacturing, so we were pushing the limits of manufacturing capabilities because the ratio of the neck size, the diameter here is very small compared to the balloon itself.  00:08:41 Speaker 2  OK. So it's it's hard to remove it from the mandrel that's used for molding.  00:08:51 Speaker 2  So there were multiple iterations to to determine what shape would be OK for a manufacturing perspective, but also give us the dimensions that we wanted once the balloon was inflated. So there's been about.  00:09:11 Speaker 2  5 iterations that have been done so far.

---

So there have been iterations around the molded.  00:11:38 Speaker 2  Part just to to make it work from a manufacturing stuff.  00:11:44 Speaker 2  Points compared to the initial design we had made. So there's been quite a bit of back and forth and we've recently received the first molded connector that required some additional design changes, but.  00:12:04 Speaker 2  Is close to being a finished a finished component.  00:12:11 Speaker 2  For the gasket as well, we've launched molding of the gasket.

So that was also due this year.  00:12:43 Speaker 2  UM and we assembled for the first time this inflation tubing and the stock.

Audio file  Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  If it works, yeah. So the the recorder is on.  00:00:06 Speaker 1  So maybe I would let you explain what was done last year and we'll start from there.  00:00:15 Speaker 2  OK, perfect. So just to confirm it's from the period of January to May.  00:00:21 Speaker 2  Or OK.  00:00:21 Speaker 1  Yes, correct.

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

  Required:    True

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

The.  00:06:16 Speaker 2  They had a earlier generation product that had four balloons and we were using that catheter as the starting point and increasing it up to 10.  00:06:21 Speaker 1  Yes.  00:06:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:06:31 Speaker 1  All right, so Gate was used to do some.  00:06:38 Speaker 1  Pre testing and to to understand the balloons behaved OK so then after that we said that single and dual neck design were evaluated.  00:06:41 Speaker 2  Yes.  00:06:52 Speaker 1  3rd.  00:06:55 Speaker 1  Was observed at the dual neck cause shaft kinking.  00:07:02 Speaker 1  So the decision was made to use a single mech design, so the single neck the the neck this is.  00:07:13 Speaker 1  I'm trying to understand that I'm not sure I understand the what what you just described the the, the the.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

So what we did you described before was really the balloon.  00:07:25 Speaker 2  I can pull up a diagram that might be easier so I can show you.  00:07:25 Speaker 1  For the measurement.  00:07:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:31  And.  00:07:38 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:38 Speaker 2  Those necks on on both like this little piece here and here and throughout the centre of the balloons. And then this portion here on the large.  00:07:47 Speaker 2  1.  00:07:48 Speaker 1  OK, so that's the design of the neck to assemble the the larger balloon onto the the shaft of the the device. Right. OK. And what? OK. So what were the issues with? Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck.

---

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

And the reason we wanted it so small here for the neck of the balloon was so that it would be the exactly the same size as the shaft that it's being split on to so that it could be bonded very easily.  00:15:57 Speaker 1  Mm-hmm.  00:16:01 Speaker 1  OK.  00:16:03 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK.  00:16:07 Speaker 1  OK, well I can I think I can start with that.  00:16:12 Speaker 2  OK.  00:16:13 Speaker 1  I don't know if there's any other topics that should include in the.  00:16:19 Speaker 1  The report.  00:16:21 Speaker 2  I think those are the big ones. The biggest focus has been the the sensing balloons, the only additional.  00:16:22 Speaker 1  Yeah. OK.  00:16:28 Speaker 2  Testing that we've done has been with accelerated aging and seeing.  00:16:32 Speaker 2  How that affects?  00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components.


  Subsection: Line 242 - A. Background

QUESTION #7: What problem existed prior to beginning that required experimentations and development to resolve?

  Field:       long_text
  Limit:       SENTENCES = 2 (1-2 sentences)
  Required:    True

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

So therefore the balloons would shrink in size.  00:01:22 Speaker 2  So there's been a lot of work to try to find how we could change the angles of the balloon, the geometry altogether, the size of the balloon.  00:01:33 Speaker 2  The spacing between balloons so that we could get something that could reach the pressure ranges that we want and that's actually still ongoing, but we're not, we're not.  00:01:44 Speaker 2  There just yet.  00:01:45 Speaker 2  And the the biggest challenge is that we're getting the balloons right now that are still too small. So we miss out on the upper pressure ranges that we want to.  00:01:53 Speaker 2  Measure.  00:01:54 Speaker 1  OK, So what was? Can you be more specific on the the iterations that were done?  00:02:05 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:02:07 Speaker 2  So there were iterations to keep the spacing between all the balloons the same and try to see how big we could get the diameter. So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons.

---

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

00:13:44 Speaker 1  Trials for the.  00:13:47 Speaker 1  The the joining of the the neck of the big balloon to the the shaft. What were the issues there that you had to try different options?  00:14:00 Speaker 2  Yeah. So the the issue with that, the neck is very small compared to the size of the balloon. Yeah. And the difference in those sizes kind of pushes the limits of what's traditionally manufactured. So there were multiple iterations done to.  00:14:20 Speaker 2  Change basically the the angles on the balloon so that it could be demoted.  00:14:28 Speaker 2  For manufacturing, since the original design was not coming off of the mandrel on which it was molded, so there were designs to change, the angles change the overall profile of the balloon slightly, so change the the length versus.  00:14:48 Speaker 2  The width of the balloon and play with the thickness of the balloon so that it could be.  00:14:53 Speaker 2  Peeled off of the mandrill.  00:14:57 Speaker 2  Does that make sense?  00:14:58 Speaker 1  OK. So during the manufacturing.  00:15:02 Speaker 2  Yes. OK. Yeah.

---

So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons. There were iterations that were made.  00:02:27 Speaker 2  And changing the shape so to go from A to go to a thinner balloon that was more like a ring versus a sphere to try to see if that would help with the geometry. There were iterations to play.  00:02:43 Speaker 2  With the difference in diameter between the neck, so the portion that rests on the shaft versus the outer diameter of the balloon. So playing with those ratios, there were iterations made to play with the spacing of the.  00:03:03 Speaker 2  Balloons trying to make the spacing larger and smaller and see how the material reacted and how that affected the diameter.

---

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

---

Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck. Yeah and.  00:08:22 Speaker 2  So there were some challenges with manufacturing, so we were pushing the limits of manufacturing capabilities because the ratio of the neck size, the diameter here is very small compared to the balloon itself.  00:08:41 Speaker 2  OK. So it's it's hard to remove it from the mandrel that's used for molding.  00:08:51 Speaker 2  So there were multiple iterations to to determine what shape would be OK for a manufacturing perspective, but also give us the dimensions that we wanted once the balloon was inflated. So there's been about.  00:09:11 Speaker 2  5 iterations that have been done so far.

---

So what we did you described before was really the balloon.  00:07:25 Speaker 2  I can pull up a diagram that might be easier so I can show you.  00:07:25 Speaker 1  For the measurement.  00:07:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:31  And.  00:07:38 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:38 Speaker 2  Those necks on on both like this little piece here and here and throughout the centre of the balloons. And then this portion here on the large.  00:07:47 Speaker 2  1.  00:07:48 Speaker 1  OK, so that's the design of the neck to assemble the the larger balloon onto the the shaft of the the device. Right. OK. And what? OK. So what were the issues with? Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck.

00:13:44 Speaker 1  Trials for the.  00:13:47 Speaker 1  The the joining of the the neck of the big balloon to the the shaft. What were the issues there that you had to try different options?  00:14:00 Speaker 2  Yeah. So the the issue with that, the neck is very small compared to the size of the balloon. Yeah.

So during the manufacturing.  00:15:02 Speaker 2  Yes. OK. Yeah.

Looking at slight modifications to the shape of the balloon as well as thickness of the balloon to give us the right the right growth profile of the balloon that we want.  00:09:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:09:29 Speaker 1  OK, so this is uh, this is ongoing work or yeah. OK.  00:09:35 Speaker 2  That is ongoing. Yes, we're receiving another iteration today, actually.  00:09:39 Speaker 1  OK.  00:09:43 Speaker 1  OK, so over the last 5-6 months.  00:09:51 Speaker 1  What were the new?  00:09:56 Speaker 1  Now I'm I'm OK with the the middle section. I'm going to summarize the activities. Now. What can we say about the the new learnings, the new?  00:10:10 Speaker 1  That that, that was acquired during the the those six months.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  So I there were definitely learnings around the behavior of the materials and how that affected a geometry of the different balloons.

---

So right now it's kind of been a combination of all of those aspects that have come together to make the mold that we're working on now.  00:03:21 Speaker 2  Still, some adjustments to be made, but we're getting closer.  00:03:25  OK.  00:03:27 Speaker 1  UM, OK.  00:03:34 Speaker 1  OK, let's uh covers it and.  00:03:37 Speaker 2  There.  00:03:38 Speaker 2  Also, I guess a new challenge that arose with the balloons as well. So the balloons are only partially inflated. They're not fully inflated. So they're a little.  00:03:50  Soft.  00:03:51 Speaker 2  So that you can measure low pressures because if you put too much air in the Blues it it will be there will be over pressurized so you won't. You won't detect small changes and and pressure and that's not good for disease patients because they read naturally.  00:04:10 Speaker 2  Very low pressures in the abdomen. So a challenge that we came across was that the material had a certain shape memory.

---

There's also been some learnings around.  00:10:35 Speaker 2  The processing.  00:10:36 Speaker 2  Steps to be able to bond the balloons onto the shaft so we're actively still exploring laser bonding versus thermal bonding versus using glues and trying to fine tune those parameters and want to bond the balloons.  00:10:51 Speaker 1  OK.  00:10:54 Speaker 1  And this would be.  00:10:58 Speaker 1  For the both sections the the measuring buildings and.  00:11:02 Speaker 2  The the bonding challenges or the the bonding iterations have.  00:11:07 Speaker 2  Been for the large balloon.  00:11:09 Speaker 1  OK.  00:11:10 Speaker 2  OK, but the geometry learnings have been for, for.  00:11:16 Speaker 2  Both balloons, really.  00:11:17 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:11:19 Speaker 2  Let's see. We've also since then launched molding of the connector and the gasket that sits on the end of the connector that acts as the sealing point with the charger.

So therefore the balloons would shrink in size.  00:01:22 Speaker 2  So there's been a lot of work to try to find how we could change the angles of the balloon, the geometry altogether, the size of the balloon.  00:01:33 Speaker 2  The spacing between balloons so that we could get something that could reach the pressure ranges that we want and that's actually still ongoing, but we're not, we're not.  00:01:44 Speaker 2  There just yet.  00:01:45 Speaker 2  And the the biggest challenge is that we're getting the balloons right now that are still too small. So we miss out on the upper pressure ranges that we want to.  00:01:53 Speaker 2  Measure.  00:01:54 Speaker 1  OK, So what was? Can you be more specific on the the iterations that were done?  00:02:05 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:02:07 Speaker 2  So there were iterations to keep the spacing between all the balloons the same and try to see how big we could get the diameter. So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons.

Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

So what we did you described before was really the balloon.  00:07:25 Speaker 2  I can pull up a diagram that might be easier so I can show you.  00:07:25 Speaker 1  For the measurement.  00:07:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:31  And.  00:07:38 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:38 Speaker 2  Those necks on on both like this little piece here and here and throughout the centre of the balloons. And then this portion here on the large.  00:07:47 Speaker 2  1.  00:07:48 Speaker 1  OK, so that's the design of the neck to assemble the the larger balloon onto the the shaft of the the device. Right. OK. And what? OK. So what were the issues with? Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck.

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck. Yeah and.  00:08:22 Speaker 2  So there were some challenges with manufacturing, so we were pushing the limits of manufacturing capabilities because the ratio of the neck size, the diameter here is very small compared to the balloon itself.  00:08:41 Speaker 2  OK. So it's it's hard to remove it from the mandrel that's used for molding.  00:08:51 Speaker 2  So there were multiple iterations to to determine what shape would be OK for a manufacturing perspective, but also give us the dimensions that we wanted once the balloon was inflated. So there's been about.  00:09:11 Speaker 2  5 iterations that have been done so far.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

---

So what we did you described before was really the balloon.  00:07:25 Speaker 2  I can pull up a diagram that might be easier so I can show you.  00:07:25 Speaker 1  For the measurement.  00:07:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:31  And.  00:07:38 Speaker 1  OK.  00:07:38 Speaker 2  Those necks on on both like this little piece here and here and throughout the centre of the balloons.

Right. OK. And what? OK. So what were the issues with? Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck.

---

So therefore the balloons would shrink in size.  00:01:22 Speaker 2  So there's been a lot of work to try to find how we could change the angles of the balloon, the geometry altogether, the size of the balloon.  00:01:33 Speaker 2  The spacing between balloons so that we could get something that could reach the pressure ranges that we want and that's actually still ongoing, but we're not, we're not.  00:01:44 Speaker 2  There just yet.  00:01:45 Speaker 2  And the the biggest challenge is that we're getting the balloons right now that are still too small. So we miss out on the upper pressure ranges that we want to.  00:01:53 Speaker 2  Measure.  00:01:54 Speaker 1  OK, So what was? Can you be more specific on the the iterations that were done?  00:02:05 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:02:07 Speaker 2  So there were iterations to keep the spacing between all the balloons the same and try to see how big we could get the diameter. So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons.


  Subsection: Line 242 - E. Hypothesis

QUESTION #14: What is the hypothesis to overcome these uncertainties, and why?

  Required:    True

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

Alright. OK.  00:17:41 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:17:43 Speaker 1  So I'll work with that.  00:17:46 Speaker 1  And I'll probably be able to.

---

So right now it's kind of been a combination of all of those aspects that have come together to make the mold that we're working on now.  00:03:21 Speaker 2  Still, some adjustments to be made, but we're getting closer.  00:03:25  OK.  00:03:27 Speaker 1  UM, OK.  00:03:34 Speaker 1  OK, let's uh covers it and.  00:03:37 Speaker 2  There.  00:03:38 Speaker 2  Also, I guess a new challenge that arose with the balloons as well. So the balloons are only partially inflated. They're not fully inflated. So they're a little.  00:03:50  Soft.  00:03:51 Speaker 2  So that you can measure low pressures because if you put too much air in the Blues it it will be there will be over pressurized so you won't. You won't detect small changes and and pressure and that's not good for disease patients because they read naturally.  00:04:10 Speaker 2  Very low pressures in the abdomen. So a challenge that we came across was that the material had a certain shape memory.

---

So a challenge that we came across was that the material had a certain shape memory. So it was naturally inflating by.  00:04:22 Speaker 2  Itself, instead of just relaxing and then us putting in the amount of air into balloons that into the balloons that we want, so we actually have to modify the entire system. So I guess just to backtrack this two parts to the system, there's the catheter that will that we are building and the.  00:04:42 Speaker 2  Charger that's being built by our clients, but they interface together so there's some back and forth that's happening on both sides.  00:04:51 Speaker 2  So what we ended up doing was adding a vacuum step into the into the charger to remove all of the natural air due to the shape memory of the balloons and then put back in the right amount of air that we want. So that was initially not something that was part of the scope and discovered over the course of the project.  00:05:10  OK.  00:05:12 Speaker 1  Good.  00:05:14 Speaker 1  U.  00:05:14 Speaker 1  M OK, the other aspect that we had there was the development of a single neck TP balloon. So what is the the difference of that to?

---

There's also been some learnings around.  00:10:35 Speaker 2  The processing.  00:10:36 Speaker 2  Steps to be able to bond the balloons onto the shaft so we're actively still exploring laser bonding versus thermal bonding versus using glues and trying to fine tune those parameters and want to bond the balloons.  00:10:51 Speaker 1  OK.  00:10:54 Speaker 1  And this would be.  00:10:58 Speaker 1  For the both sections the the measuring buildings and.  00:11:02 Speaker 2  The the bonding challenges or the the bonding iterations have.  00:11:07 Speaker 2  Been for the large balloon.  00:11:09 Speaker 1  OK.  00:11:10 Speaker 2  OK, but the geometry learnings have been for, for.  00:11:16 Speaker 2  Both balloons, really.  00:11:17 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:11:19 Speaker 2  Let's see. We've also since then launched molding of the connector and the gasket that sits on the end of the connector that acts as the sealing point with the charger.

---

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

Looking at slight modifications to the shape of the balloon as well as thickness of the balloon to give us the right the right growth profile of the balloon that we want.  00:09:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:09:29 Speaker 1  OK, so this is uh, this is ongoing work or yeah. OK.  00:09:35 Speaker 2  That is ongoing. Yes, we're receiving another iteration today, actually.  00:09:39 Speaker 1  OK.  00:09:43 Speaker 1  OK, so over the last 5-6 months.  00:09:51 Speaker 1  What were the new?  00:09:56 Speaker 1  Now I'm I'm OK with the the middle section. I'm going to summarize the activities. Now. What can we say about the the new learnings, the new?  00:10:10 Speaker 1  That that, that was acquired during the the those six months.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  So I there were definitely learnings around the behavior of the materials and how that affected a geometry of the different balloons.

---

So therefore the balloons would shrink in size.  00:01:22 Speaker 2  So there's been a lot of work to try to find how we could change the angles of the balloon, the geometry altogether, the size of the balloon.  00:01:33 Speaker 2  The spacing between balloons so that we could get something that could reach the pressure ranges that we want and that's actually still ongoing, but we're not, we're not.  00:01:44 Speaker 2  There just yet.  00:01:45 Speaker 2  And the the biggest challenge is that we're getting the balloons right now that are still too small. So we miss out on the upper pressure ranges that we want to.  00:01:53 Speaker 2  Measure.  00:01:54 Speaker 1  OK, So what was? Can you be more specific on the the iterations that were done?  00:02:05 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:02:07 Speaker 2  So there were iterations to keep the spacing between all the balloons the same and try to see how big we could get the diameter.

So there have been iterations around the molded.  00:11:38 Speaker 2  Part just to to make it work from a manufacturing stuff.  00:11:44 Speaker 2  Points compared to the initial design we had made. So there's been quite a bit of back and forth and we've recently received the first molded connector that required some additional design changes, but.  00:12:04 Speaker 2  Is close to being a finished a finished component.  00:12:11 Speaker 2  For the gasket as well, we've launched molding of the gasket. We determined that specific material for the gasket provided the best seals. There were multiple iterations of testing done to figure out the right thermometer of material that would be required.  00:12:31 Speaker 2  For the seal.  00:12:32 Speaker 2  So we decided on a 3D A and launched molding of that component. So that was also due this year.  00:12:43 Speaker 2  UM and we assembled for the first time this inflation tubing and the stock.

---

So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons. There were iterations that were made.  00:02:27 Speaker 2  And changing the shape so to go from A to go to a thinner balloon that was more like a ring versus a sphere to try to see if that would help with the geometry. There were iterations to play.  00:02:43 Speaker 2  With the difference in diameter between the neck, so the portion that rests on the shaft versus the outer diameter of the balloon. So playing with those ratios, there were iterations made to play with the spacing of the.  00:03:03 Speaker 2  Balloons trying to make the spacing larger and smaller and see how the material reacted and how that affected the diameter.

00:10:10 Speaker 1  That that, that was acquired during the the those six months.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  So I there were definitely learnings around the behavior of the materials and how that affected a geometry of the different balloons.

And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

---

OK. Yeah. So there were there were iterations that they would suggest that they would say, OK, we're not able to remove it. We think changing the angles would be the right course of action. We redesigned the balloon and went back to the.  00:15:04 Speaker 1  So is is it so?  00:15:18 Speaker 2  To the supplier to to change the drawings. And there's been about 5 back and forth iterations with them on that.  00:15:27 Speaker 1  OK, so it's the the the 1st.  00:15:31 Speaker 1  Portion of the balloon the from the shaft to where there's the angle. This is a A.  00:15:38 Speaker 1  Rigid portion of the.  00:15:41 Speaker 2  No, it's all. It's all soft material. The whole balloon is soft material. And the reason we wanted it so small here for the neck of the balloon was so that it would be the exactly the same size as the shaft that it's being split on to so that it could be bonded very easily.  00:15:57 Speaker 1  Mm-hmm.  00:16:01 Speaker 1  OK.  00:16:03 Speaker 1  Yeah.

So right now it's kind of been a combination of all of those aspects that have come together to make the mold that we're working on now.  00:03:21 Speaker 2  Still, some adjustments to be made, but we're getting closer.  00:03:25  OK.  00:03:27 Speaker 1  UM, OK.  00:03:34 Speaker 1  OK, let's uh covers it and.  00:03:37 Speaker 2  There.  00:03:38 Speaker 2  Also, I guess a new challenge that arose with the balloons as well. So the balloons are only partially inflated. They're not fully inflated. So they're a little.  00:03:50  Soft.  00:03:51 Speaker 2  So that you can measure low pressures because if you put too much air in the Blues it it will be there will be over pressurized so you won't. You won't detect small changes and and pressure and that's not good for disease patients because they read naturally.  00:04:10 Speaker 2  Very low pressures in the abdomen. So a challenge that we came across was that the material had a certain shape memory.

---

There's also been some learnings around.  00:10:35 Speaker 2  The processing.  00:10:36 Speaker 2  Steps to be able to bond the balloons onto the shaft so we're actively still exploring laser bonding versus thermal bonding versus using glues and trying to fine tune those parameters and want to bond the balloons.  00:10:51 Speaker 1  OK.  00:10:54 Speaker 1  And this would be.  00:10:58 Speaker 1  For the both sections the the measuring buildings and.  00:11:02 Speaker 2  The the bonding challenges or the the bonding iterations have.  00:11:07 Speaker 2  Been for the large balloon.  00:11:09 Speaker 1  OK.  00:11:10 Speaker 2  OK, but the geometry learnings have been for, for.  00:11:16 Speaker 2  Both balloons, really.  00:11:17 Speaker 1  Yeah.  00:11:19 Speaker 2  Let's see. We've also since then launched molding of the connector and the gasket that sits on the end of the connector that acts as the sealing point with the charger.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.

The.  00:06:16 Speaker 2  They had a earlier generation product that had four balloons and we were using that catheter as the starting point and increasing it up to 10.  00:06:21 Speaker 1  Yes.  00:06:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:06:31 Speaker 1  All right, so Gate was used to do some.  00:06:38 Speaker 1  Pre testing and to to understand the balloons behaved OK so then after that we said that single and dual neck design were evaluated.  00:06:41 Speaker 2  Yes.  00:06:52 Speaker 1  3rd.  00:06:55 Speaker 1  Was observed at the dual neck cause shaft kinking.  00:07:02 Speaker 1  So the decision was made to use a single mech design, so the single neck the the neck this is.  00:07:13 Speaker 1  I'm trying to understand that I'm not sure I understand the what what you just described the the, the the.

---

So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons. There were iterations that were made.  00:02:27 Speaker 2  And changing the shape so to go from A to go to a thinner balloon that was more like a ring versus a sphere to try to see if that would help with the geometry. There were iterations to play.  00:02:43 Speaker 2  With the difference in diameter between the neck, so the portion that rests on the shaft versus the outer diameter of the balloon. So playing with those ratios, there were iterations made to play with the spacing of the.  00:03:03 Speaker 2  Balloons trying to make the spacing larger and smaller and see how the material reacted and how that affected the diameter.

---

So there have been iterations around the molded.  00:11:38 Speaker 2  Part just to to make it work from a manufacturing stuff.  00:11:44 Speaker 2  Points compared to the initial design we had made. So there's been quite a bit of back and forth and we've recently received the first molded connector that required some additional design changes, but.  00:12:04 Speaker 2  Is close to being a finished a finished component.  00:12:11 Speaker 2  For the gasket as well, we've launched molding of the gasket. We determined that specific material for the gasket provided the best seals. There were multiple iterations of testing done to figure out the right thermometer of material that would be required.  00:12:31 Speaker 2  For the seal.  00:12:32 Speaker 2  So we decided on a 3D A and launched molding of that component. So that was also due this year.  00:12:43 Speaker 2  UM and we assembled for the first time this inflation tubing and the stock.

---

So what is the the difference of that to?  00:05:32 Speaker 2  So there's ten small balloons that are on the catheter, which is the 10 balloon sleeve that measures the pressures. And then on the end of the catheter, there's this very large balloon that's used to measure reflexes. So it's inflated to really large volumes compared to the other balloons.  00:05:39  Hmm.  00:05:48  OK.  00:05:51 Speaker 1  OK.  00:05:55 Speaker 1  OK, So what was?  00:06:05 Speaker 1  It's pretty good.  00:06:07 Speaker 1  Because here we were seeing the analysis of a predicate catheter.  00:06:12 Speaker 1  So predicate cadre, what does that mean?

Audio file  Transcript  00:00:00 Speaker 1  If it works, yeah. So the the recorder is on.  00:00:06 Speaker 1  So maybe I would let you explain what was done last year and we'll start from there.  00:00:15 Speaker 2  OK, perfect. So just to confirm it's from the period of January to May.  00:00:21 Speaker 2  Or OK.  00:00:21 Speaker 1  Yes, correct.

So therefore the balloons would shrink in size.  00:01:22 Speaker 2  So there's been a lot of work to try to find how we could change the angles of the balloon, the geometry altogether, the size of the balloon.  00:01:33 Speaker 2  The spacing between balloons so that we could get something that could reach the pressure ranges that we want and that's actually still ongoing, but we're not, we're not.  00:01:44 Speaker 2  There just yet.  00:01:45 Speaker 2  And the the biggest challenge is that we're getting the balloons right now that are still too small. So we miss out on the upper pressure ranges that we want to.  00:01:53 Speaker 2  Measure.  00:01:54 Speaker 1  OK, So what was? Can you be more specific on the the iterations that were done?  00:02:05 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:02:07 Speaker 2  So there were iterations to keep the spacing between all the balloons the same and try to see how big we could get the diameter. So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons.

---

Yes, yes, yes.  00:00:24 Speaker 2  OK, perfect.  00:00:26 Speaker 2  So I might overlap a little bit with what was done before and a little bit after, but I could always go back and check the exact exact timelines, but like you mentioned, one of the points that was continued from the last report was working on the 10 balloon sleeve geometry and that is.  00:00:34  Yeah.  00:00:35  Hmm.  00:00:47 Speaker 2  Actually still ongoing, we had a lot of challenges from a manufacturing perspective getting balloons that were the right size, that could read the entire pressure range that we want from zero to 300mm of mercury.  00:01:04 Speaker 2  And that was mostly because we would start with the geometry that we knew we wanted, but the material would relaxed after they were molded.

Well, last year we decided that.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Onto.  00:08:00 Speaker 2  Shaft, yeah.  00:08:09 Speaker 1  There was this.  00:08:11 Speaker 1  Single neck versus dual neck we you opted for a single neck. Yeah and.  00:08:22 Speaker 2  So there were some challenges with manufacturing, so we were pushing the limits of manufacturing capabilities because the ratio of the neck size, the diameter here is very small compared to the balloon itself.  00:08:41 Speaker 2  OK. So it's it's hard to remove it from the mandrel that's used for molding.  00:08:51 Speaker 2  So there were multiple iterations to to determine what shape would be OK for a manufacturing perspective, but also give us the dimensions that we wanted once the balloon was inflated. So there's been about.  00:09:11 Speaker 2  5 iterations that have been done so far.

So therefore the balloons would shrink in size.  00:01:22 Speaker 2  So there's been a lot of work to try to find how we could change the angles of the balloon, the geometry altogether, the size of the balloon.  00:01:33 Speaker 2  The spacing between balloons so that we could get something that could reach the pressure ranges that we want and that's actually still ongoing, but we're not, we're not.  00:01:44 Speaker 2  There just yet.  00:01:45 Speaker 2  And the the biggest challenge is that we're getting the balloons right now that are still too small. So we miss out on the upper pressure ranges that we want to.  00:01:53 Speaker 2  Measure.  00:01:54 Speaker 1  OK, So what was? Can you be more specific on the the iterations that were done?  00:02:05 Speaker 2  Yeah.  00:02:07 Speaker 2  So there were iterations to keep the spacing between all the balloons the same and try to see how big we could get the diameter. So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons.

So there were multiple molds that were made to try to push the limits of how big we could blow the balloons. There were iterations that were made.  00:02:27 Speaker 2  And changing the shape so to go from A to go to a thinner balloon that was more like a ring versus a sphere to try to see if that would help with the geometry. There were iterations to play.  00:02:43 Speaker 2  With the difference in diameter between the neck, so the portion that rests on the shaft versus the outer diameter of the balloon. So playing with those ratios, there were iterations made to play with the spacing of the.  00:03:03 Speaker 2  Balloons trying to make the spacing larger and smaller and see how the material reacted and how that affected the diameter.

  RETRIEVED CONTEXT:

00:10:10 Speaker 1  That that, that was acquired during the the those six months.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  So I there were definitely learnings around the behavior of the materials and how that affected a geometry of the different balloons.

Looking at slight modifications to the shape of the balloon as well as thickness of the balloon to give us the right the right growth profile of the balloon that we want.  00:09:28 Speaker 1  OK.  00:09:29 Speaker 1  OK, so this is uh, this is ongoing work or yeah. OK.  00:09:35 Speaker 2  That is ongoing. Yes, we're receiving another iteration today, actually.  00:09:39 Speaker 1  OK.  00:09:43 Speaker 1  OK, so over the last 5-6 months.  00:09:51 Speaker 1  What were the new?  00:09:56 Speaker 1  Now I'm I'm OK with the the middle section. I'm going to summarize the activities. Now. What can we say about the the new learnings, the new?  00:10:10 Speaker 1  That that, that was acquired during the the those six months.  00:10:17 Speaker 2  So I there were definitely learnings around the behavior of the materials and how that affected a geometry of the different balloons.

00:16:33 Speaker 2  The different joints and the components. So we've been repeatedly testing at different intervals of accelerated aging to see if we need to change any of the processes or the designs.  00:16:44 Speaker 1  OK. And so as of mid-May?  00:16:49 Speaker 1  What was the status of the the project?  00:16:54 Speaker 2  I would say we were still in active iterations on the sensing balloon. Active iterations on the distal balloon we were just before receiving a molded connector.  00:17:12 Speaker 2  So we we haven't done an iteration on the connector just yet and we had recognized the issue with the glue between the joint of the inflation tubing and the stock clock and had started iterations on that.  00:17:29 Speaker 1  OK.  00:17:30 Speaker 1  So you said it is stop.  00:17:32 Speaker 1  The.  00:17:34 Speaker 2  Talk.  00:17:35 Speaker 1  Stop talk. OK. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Alright.
