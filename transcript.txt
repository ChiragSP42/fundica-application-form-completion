Excellent. All right. So for today, we're going to be kicking off this POC. We'll do team introductions briefly. I'll talk about the project overview and objectives, project prereq, which we kind of touched on the e-mail regarding access, what's in and out of scope, what we'll be delivering at the end of this POC and timeline and project assumption.

So for the first meeting like I I got a fair bit of understanding from the SOW as to what needs to be done with respect to the company and domain matching and how to go about it with the with the hybrid architecture. What I'm unclear about is the actual data itself like.
Chirag Panchakshari 12 minutes 51 seconds
Over a broad overview I can see I can I can see the design, but the specific if I try to zoom into the specific elements and the and the logic, that's where I get. That's where I'm unclear. So maybe a bit a bit more insight into the actual data what what are the companies?
Chirag Panchakshari 13 minutes 10 seconds
What's the format of the data, the domain sources, how the current system is matching it as of right now? What's the baseline accuracy and we can move on from there?
Chirag Panchakshari 13 minutes 29 seconds
What do you think?
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
13 minutes 31 seconds13:31
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 13 minutes 31 seconds
Yeah, no, I think, yeah, that that's, I think it is right right now if you want, but so basically.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 13 minutes 41 seconds
Do you want to do it now or do you want to wait until tomorrow? It's up to you.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
13 minutes 46 seconds13:46
Chirag Panchakshari 13 minutes 46 seconds
We can do it tomorrow. Also, how do you pronounce your name?
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
13 minutes 47 seconds13:47
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 13 minutes 47 seconds
No.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 13 minutes 51 seconds
Stuff.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
13 minutes 52 seconds13:52
Chirag Panchakshari 13 minutes 52 seconds
Shaf. OK, nice to meet you.

We can hear it tomorrow.

Kacy Kelly
13 minutes 56 seconds13:56
Kacy Kelly 13 minutes 56 seconds
So we only have the half hour. Yeah, I don't want to rush anything with the time, rather have the dedicated time for tomorrow for for the hour so we can give the proper dedicated time that we need. And then after the meeting on the 4th, he'll give the team more time to form kind of best approach the following meeting and so forth so.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
14 minutes14:00
Chirag Panchakshari 14 minutes
Yeah.

Shavkatjon Hamdamov
14 minutes 15 seconds14:15
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 14 minutes 15 seconds
Yeah.

Kacy Kelly
14 minutes 16 seconds14:16
Kacy Kelly 14 minutes 16 seconds
No concerns, but I'd rather not try to begin a conversation than have to end in 10 minutes.
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
14 minutes 22 seconds14:22
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 14 minutes 22 seconds
You know one thing I want to keep to you.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 14 minutes 31 seconds
Is this oh?
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 14 minutes 41 seconds
Someone published the the medium article.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 14 minutes 49 seconds
Trying to address the same or similar issue using.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 14 minutes 55 seconds
As for cosine similarity.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 15 minutes 1 second
Um and with some um and and and training.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 15 minutes 7 seconds
A regression model, I think it's it it.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 15 minutes 14 seconds
Kinda works, so let me find that so I can share that with you so you can.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 15 minutes 23 seconds
We can go through it because that that's gonna give you a lot of kind of context, much more laid out to the software.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 15 minutes 36 seconds
Returns off the problem statement.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 15 minutes 40 seconds
So let me share my screen real quick.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 1 second
Oh.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 4 seconds
Can you see my screen? Can I will share this video?

Kacy Kelly
16 minutes 8 seconds16:08
Kacy Kelly 16 minutes 8 seconds
Yeah.
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
16 minutes 13 seconds16:13
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 13 seconds
So basically.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 22 seconds
So yeah, this is a medium object on it as it gets how blank and you can feel better. The problem is this the.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 33 seconds
And name comes in. Um.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 37 seconds
The name comes in and this is the the matching name to name. We do the same thing. We also will need to match it to the domain as well when we cannot match the the name to name.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 16 minutes 53 seconds
So this is a simplified version though, because they're just matching based on the name.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 2 seconds
The biggest problem that we have is that the.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 7 seconds
Um.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 9 seconds
Most of the time when I do the matching.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 14 seconds
I have more than one account account matched because we have 50 million rows in the in the in the in the table that does this matching. So most of the time when I say most like a probably.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 32 seconds
7580% of the time I have more than one account matched to the one name.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 39 seconds
So the so the problematic part is basically decides the which one of the matched one.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 49 seconds
We should pick at that certain time.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 17 minutes 53 seconds
And and the at the same time we don't have any more context from the input other than the name they want us to match.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 18 minutes 6 seconds
Um, so.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 18 minutes 10 seconds
We have some type of prioritization rule we put in and in the in sequel in sequel based solution that we have and it it works and with that we get to that 8590% accuracy.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 18 minutes 28 seconds
And the idea is that the replicate that level of accuracy with agents. So it is, it's a faster solution. So right now that's so quality solution is slow.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 18 minutes 44 seconds
Um.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 18 minutes 46 seconds
So yeah, that's that's basically the problem statement, yeah.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 18 minutes 52 seconds
So I can share this with you and kind of the read it for your kind of when you have time. And then yeah, that's gonna give you a very good context in terms of the.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 19 minutes 11 seconds
What we are trying to do, the only the difference from that one is the, as I said, prioritization logic.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 19 minutes 21 seconds
Of this of after, after the match happens, how we're going to prioritize to pick that specific one that we want. There are rules that we have we put in the SQL.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 19 minutes 37 seconds
And it does that work right? Uh, and the uh.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 19 minutes 42 seconds
Yeah, we can. We can use those rules if we want the.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 19 minutes 50 seconds
Moving my I'm also OK to kind of the customize it based on the customer, but I think that's gonna be a little bit tricky.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 20 minutes 2 seconds
But again, OK, that's that's where you're coming in a way.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
20 minutes 8 seconds20:08
Chirag Panchakshari 20 minutes 8 seconds
OK, makes sense. So for tomorrow's meeting, how about we start with the problem statement, like dive a little bit deeper and you can explain to us with respect to the data that you that you have while showing us the data, what the problem you're actually facing is like this helps.
Chirag Panchakshari 20 minutes 28 seconds
The the medium article, but I I I'd like to see how how do the company names look like.
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
20 minutes 32 seconds20:32
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 20 minutes 32 seconds
Yeah, I'll definitely, I'll definitely do that. I just want to give you this like a for today so that if that kind of lays out the problem and one possible way of solving it.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
20 minutes 36 seconds20:36
Chirag Panchakshari 20 minutes 36 seconds
OK.
Chirag Panchakshari 20 minutes 39 seconds
Hmm.
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
20 minutes 48 seconds20:48
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 20 minutes 48 seconds
With the with oversimplification.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
20 minutes 52 seconds20:52
Chirag Panchakshari 20 minutes 52 seconds
Mm-hmm. Perfect.
SH
Shavkatjon Hamdamov
20 minutes 54 seconds20:54
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 20 minutes 54 seconds
So it's not going to you cannot just use that as a because it's it's it's it's a slow and B it's just not gonna work for for our use case so but I will.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 21 minutes 9 seconds
Well, it's a similar in a way though.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 21 minutes 13 seconds
Problem. It's when I when you add the 50 million rows, you're going to have a complex problem compared to his matching like what, 5 records there in his example. But yeah.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 21 minutes 28 seconds
You can think it that way.
Shavkatjon Hamdamov 21 minutes 30 seconds
Yeah, I'll go through that tomorrow. We can go from there.
CP
Chirag Panchakshari
21 minutes 31 seconds21:31
Chirag Panchakshari 21 minutes 31 seconds
Yeah, that'll be good.
Chirag Panchakshari 21 minutes 35 seconds
Perfect.
Chirag Panchakshari 21 minutes 37 seconds
Oh, well, that's all I have.
